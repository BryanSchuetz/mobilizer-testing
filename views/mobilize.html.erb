    <p><strong>Congress is at it again.</strong> The <em>Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011</em> (CISPA), under discussion right now in the Congress, and the <em>SECURE IT Act</em> proposed in the Senate, both aim to give unprecedented new powers to the government and private corporationsâ€”empowering them to violate individual privacy, and alter the fundamental operating principles of the Internet.</p>

    <p>Just like with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a> our representatives demonstrate a shocking lack of understanding and/or interest in the impact this type of legislation could have on individual freedom and the fundamental nature of the Internet. As it stands now these bills:
      <ul>
        <li>Provide no standard for what type of information is allowed to be collected, leaving everything on the table</li>
        <li>Set an excessivley broad trigger, allowing private entities to employ "Cybersecurity Countermeasures" against anyone engaded in activity seen to "degrade the network"</li>
        <li>Set no limits for how information gathered can be used</li>
        <li>Create a loophole by using language ("Notwithstanding any other provision of law") that would essentially bypass all existing privacy legislation  </li>
      </ul>

    <p>As the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/yes-cispa-could-allow-companies-filter-or-block-internet-traffic">points out</a>:
      <blockquote>This opens the door for ISPs and other companies to perform aggressive countermeasures like dropping or altering packets, so long as this is used as part of a scheme to identify cybersecurity threats. These countermeasures could put free speech in peril, and jeopardize the ordinary functioning of the Internet. This could also mean blocking websites, or disrupting privacy-enhancing technologies such as Tor. These countermeasures could even serve as a back door to enact policies unrelated to cybersecurity, such as disrupting p2p traffic.</blockquote>
